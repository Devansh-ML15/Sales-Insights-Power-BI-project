# Sales-Insights-Power-BI-project
ATLIQ hardware is a company that supplies computer hardware and peripherals to store clients across the whole of India. Bhavin Patel is the sales director of this company and he is facing a lot of challenges. The market is growing dynamically and he has issues tracking the market and insights of his business. So he calls all the managers to ask for the status of the business and they will send all the updates of happened quarters through excel files. To find insights from these excel files is a very hard and tedious task to do. So because of this, Bhavin Patel is not getting any insights into where his business is going right or where he has to improve it. As Bhavin Patel is struggling to get any insights into where his business is going right or where he has to improve it, we will help him to get insights using Azure service called "Power BI". IT team named Falcons has created software that keeps track of all sales numbers by printing and storing invoices after selling hardware equipment. All these records are stored in the MySql database. Now we Data analyst team, who are known as "Data Masters", will use this data to create a dashboard in Power BI and get insights to improve the business.
